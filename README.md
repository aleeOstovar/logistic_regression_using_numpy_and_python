# logistic regression using numpy and python

In this project, I implement a regression model in two ways ,one without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels,
and the other one using scikit-learn library.
Project Structure is divided into following tasks:

1.Introduction and Project Overview

2.Load the Data and Import Libraries

3.Visualize the Data

4.Define the Logistic Sigmoid Function 𝜎(𝑧)

5.Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(w,b) and Gradient

6.Cost and Gradient at Initialization

7.Implement Gradient Descent

8.Plotting the Convergence of 𝐽(w,b)

9.Plotting the Decision Boundary

10.Predictions Using the Optimized w and b Values
